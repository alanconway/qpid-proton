 * **Experimental** - Multithreaded IO

 * The proactor associates a @ref connection with a @ref transport,
 * either by making an outgoing connection or accepting an incoming
 * one.  It delivers @ref event "events" to application threads for
 * handling.
 *
 * ## Multi-threading
 *
 * The @ref proactor is thread-safe, but the protocol engine is not.
 * The proactor ensures that each @ref connection and its associated
 * values (@ref session, @ref link etc.) is handle sequentially, even
 * if there are multiple application threads. See pn_proactor_wait().
